Description: In this code, the user has access to an interactice calender in which they can plan their work day from 9 to 5. The calendar will tell them what the exact time and day is, as well as saving inputs locally of what they decide to input. This page will also save their info if the page reloads, and can edit events too even after the page has been reloaded.
